# FM-Swedish-Lower-Divisions
A project with the goal of adding all swedish football divisions below division 2 to football manager.

Currently the only division added is division 3, this does not include adding the actual players to all teams or changing any other team info. The division is however completely playable which was the goal of this initial version.

TODO:

1. Adding the extra game that should be played between the division 3 team and the best division 4 team for each division 3 playoff group so that it works like in real life. Unsure how to do this at the moment.
2. Adding the rest of the lower division and their rules.
3. Adding correct players and staff to each team.
